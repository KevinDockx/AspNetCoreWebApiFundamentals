# ASP.NET Core Web API Fundamentals
Fully functioning sample code for my ASP.NET Core Web API Fundamentals course, currently targeting .NET 8.

The **main** branch exactly matches the course.
The **latest-and-greatest** branch contains changes that were incorporated after recording. Most often these changes are language features that are relatively new and/or in preview, like primary constructors, switch expressions and so on. Most of these changes will probably make it into the main branch when course updates happen, but if you don't want to wait for that you can already check it out - enjoy :-)
